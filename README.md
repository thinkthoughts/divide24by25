# divide24by25  
### A Protocol for Automated Redistribution  

## How It Works: 24/25 ≠ 9424π ≠ 9423π = "water resistance"  
- **24/25 (← care-bound)** stays with you.  
- **1/25 (→ regenerative pools)** flows outward.  

## Why?  
"Zero life" is proviolent. Antiviolent thinking expands imaginations to extend care while resisting gravity (now) ≠ 9424π

## Get Started  
1. Clone this repo.  
2. Deploy `divide24by25.sol`.  
3. Let the 1/25 flow.
